"Travelling SalesMan Problem-Implementation"
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is to solve a problem for a salesman to find the shortest path of a tour for  visiting  a series of cities exactly once.  It is a model of NP related to graphs. It is a classic problem in the area of computer science being solved in various approaches. We compared the solutions using a  brute-force algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm to solve TSP. The performance increaseson using  the dynamic programming  than the brute-force algorithm in terms of running time. 
The brute force implementation makes use of  https://github.com/Bjoern/Traveling-Salesman/blob/master/src/net/blinker/tsm/TravelingSalesmanBruteForce.java

TSPlib data files under the data/tsp files are used.
